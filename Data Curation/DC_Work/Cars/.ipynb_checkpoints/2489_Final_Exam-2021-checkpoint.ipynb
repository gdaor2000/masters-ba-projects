    "# 2489-2021 Data Curation T1 Final Exam \n",
    "\n",
    "The final exam will contain 1 question with subquestions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lemon or Peach? (60 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who have taken ECON 101, you should already be quite familar with the term **lemon car** that refers to a car found to be defective only after it has been bought. In 1970, economist George Akerlof published a paper \"The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism\" that explored how the quality of goods traded in a market can degrade in the presence of *information asymmetry* between buyers and sellers. This leads to the **adverse selection** problem that  sellers will sell only when they hold \"lemons\" and they will leave the market when they hold \"peaches\". As such, Adverse selection is a market mechanism that can lead to a market collapse. In 2001, Akerlof, along with Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz, jointly received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for their research on issues related to asymmetric information.\n",

    "\n",
    "Online information system creates platform for buyers and sellers to trade their goods with information about the goods. However, lemon problem becomes even worse as buyers have no way to verify and examine the goods (such as used cars) and have to rely on information posted by the sellers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address this problem, large-scale historical purchase data would allow online retailers to alleviate the issue. For example, OLX group is a global online marketplace operating in 45 countries. The OLX marketplace is a platform for buying and selling services and goods such as electronics, fashion items, furniture, household goods, Properties, cars and bikes. Their business model is to charge sellers listing fees when they post the advertisement. Their business objective is to facilitate transactions on the platform such that buyers would be willing to repeately purchase quality goods with reasonable price and sellers would be willing to list more goods for profits. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the analyst, you are given the task **to examine the information about listings of used cars on OLX Portugal that a car is considered to be sold or not if the days of listing is within the 30 days.** Otherwise, the seller has to pay extra to relist the advertisement until it is sold or withdrawn. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**OLX Car Dataset (olx_car_dataset.csv)**\n",
    "All car listings are contained in the file olx_car_dataset.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one listing of car on the OLX platform, and has the following format:\n",
    "**`'ID', 'region_id', 'private_business', 'price', 'make', 'model', 'fuel_type', 'mileage', 'reg_year', 'eng_capacity', 'color', 'capacity', 'dayslive'`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns are quite self-explained. `dayslive` is the days of the listing on the OLX until the card is sold or withdrawn. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions using the provided dataset. You can write down intermediate results towards the final answers."

    "\n",
    "The dataset can store up to 10,000 car listings and therefore in total contains 3 parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, each part of the data contains a few errors that need to be resolved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the ```price``` column of part1 is mistakenly encoded as ```prices``` \n",
    "- the ```region_id``` column of part 1 is all in the wrong sign, e.g. the region_id of 11 is wrongly encoded as -11\n",
    "- the ```private_business``` column of part2 is mistakenly encoded as ```private```\n",
    "- the ```mileage``` column of part2 is miscalculated by taking a logarithm of its original value\n",
    "- the ```capacity``` column of part3 is wrongly set as missing value when the capacity is 5\n",
    "- the ```model``` column of part3 is wrongly encoded with also the ```make``` columns, e.g. BMW 320 should have BMW in the column ```make``` and 320 in the column ```model```.\n",
