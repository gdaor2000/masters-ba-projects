    "“What TV sereis should I binge-watch this evening?” This perhaps is a question you would ask yourself very often. As for me — yes, and more than once. As such, from Netflix to Hulu, the need to build robust movie recommendation systems is extremely important given the huge demand for personalized content of modern consumers. **Netflix is forecasting it will add 3.5 million paying subscribers thanks to the surprise hit Squid Games**\n",
